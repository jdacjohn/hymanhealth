<p> <img src="images/feat_travel.jpg" width="200" height="151" alt="Dr. Hyman on Travel Care" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px;">
HymanHeath’s patients frequently travel internationally whether on business or pleasure. The increase in 
<a href="travel_medicine.html">travel medicine</a> knowledge over the years makes travel care an essential part of medical care. 
Dr. Hyman as a <a href="aboutdrhyman.html">travel medicine specialist</a> counsels his patients on the appropriate 
<a href="travel_medicine.html">vaccinations and preventive medicine</a> before international trips.
HymanHealth maintains a supply of vaccines and medications to help prevent the following Illnesses: 
meningitis, polio, hepatitis A & B, pneumonia, influenza, malaria, typhoid fever and yellow fever. 
HymanHealth is certified by the California Department of Public Health to administer the <a href="travel_medicine.html">yellow fever vaccine</a>. 
Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa and sometimes others require yellow fever vaccinations prior to entering their countries or in 
order to obtain an entry visa. HymanHealth will issue an <a href="travel_medicine.html">International Certificate of Immunization</a> on the day 
of your yellow fever immunization.
We recommend seeing Dr. Hyman at least 4-6 weeks prior to departure to obtain proper immunizations and give them time to activate. Even 
if it is less than four weeks prior to your trip, please see us for as much preventive care as possible. </p>

Food Allergies - January 19,2011</h2>

<em>The Journal of the American Medical Association</em></h4>
<p> <img src="images/feat_foodallergy.jpg" width="200" height="151" alt="Common Allergic Foods" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px;">
A food allergy is an adverse immune response to a food. Your immune system makes antibodies to protect you from germs and disease, but
it may also sometimes make antibodies to certain food proteins. Some of these antibodies (called IgE) are known to be
associated with allergic reactions. When that happens, your immune system treats the food as if it were a harmful
substance, resulting in an allergic reaction. The proportion of people with food allergies is not known with precision
because of differing definitions, but it is between 2% and 10% and is more common in children than adults. <a href="Secure/Login.aspx">Become one of Dr. Hyman's patients and have exclusive access to dozens of current health articles.</a>

<h2>Web Health Heroes</h2>


<p> <img src="images/hyman_heaton.jpg" alt="" width="77" height="84" alt="Dr. Mark Hyman and Patricia Heaton" align="left" 
	style="padding-right: 10px;"/>Mark Hyman, MD, is the parent of a child with tuberous sclerosis -- a condition that
affects 50,000 people in the U.S. and causes tumors to form in the kidneys, eyes, brain, liver,
and lungs, as well as seizures, autism, and learning disabilities. As such, he wants to see
new research, better drugs and, ultimately, a cure -- and he knows all three take money. So
seven years ago, the Los Angeles-based physician came up with an idea that made him smile.
&quot;I launched <a href="http://www.webmd.com/click?url=http://www.comedyforacure.com/comedy/index.aspx"
onclick="return sl(this,'nw','hlth-heroes_4');"><strong>Comedy for a Cure</strong></a>,&quot; says Hyman,
which takes place every year in cities across the country. </p>

<p>To make the event even funnier (and even more successful) Hyman enlisted his favorite patient
funny lady Patricia Heaton of <em>Everybody Loves Raymond</em> and <em>The Middle</em> fame. The
actress was MC at the Laugh Factory that first year and has donated her time to the cause ever
since. To date their efforts have raised $2.5 million for the
<a href="http://www.webmd.com/click?url=http://www.tsalliance.org/"
onclick="return sl(this,'nw','hlth-heroes_5');"><strong>Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance</strong></a>.
Those funds have kick-started research for genetic testing during pregnancy; sponsored a clinical
trial for a new drug that may prevent and even halt tumor growth and seizures; and created the first
national TS database, which centralizes information on TS patients. Progress like this is no joke.</p>
