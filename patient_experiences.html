									  <p>The examination process is distressing to me, yet you and  your staff were tremendously patient and informative. When I left your office I  was more at ease than when I entered. You and your staff have been the most  thorough and polite group of medical personnel that I have ever encountered &ndash;  and I&rsquo;ve seen many over the years.&nbsp; Thank  you for your kindness.&quot;

I was impressed with the cleanliness of the  facility and the equipment that was used to monitor my condition. I left the  office feeling very confident that no stone was left unturned. I was very impressed  with the professionalism of the staff and their genuine concern for my health.  I want to highly recommend Dr. Hyman and his staff to anyone who suffers from  hypertension-related illnesses.&quot;

									       <blockquote>
									         <p>I am grateful that you have taken on my mother as your  patient. I have been quite concerned for many years about the lack of caring  response and involvement from her doctors and lack of coordination between  doctors. At one point she had a stroke and didn&rsquo;t get a call back from her  doctor for over a week. You have surpassed all of our hopes and dreams in what  we wanted for mother. I can not tell you how important this is or how much it  means to our family. We appreciate having her medical care in your hands.&quot;
									       </blockquote>

							          <blockquote>
							            <p>I want you to know that my dad always appreciated the care  you provided to both him and my mom. Dad considered himself an insightful  critic of medical practitioners and he often said that you were a real medical  scholar. He admired you as a doctor and valued your care.&quot;
